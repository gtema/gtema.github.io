17-minute read</span></div></div></header><div class=post-content><p>In this series of articles we are going to discuss how to configure Keystone
with an external Identity provider (federation) based on the Keycloak with
OpenIDConnect and multiple domain support. Since there are currently issues
doing so effectively the information will come synchronized with addressing of
the the mentioned challenges. This part is focused on making it possible to
have an external Identity provider and map remotely managed users to multiple
local domains and projects.</p><p><a href=https://docs.openstack.org/keystone/latest/admin/federation/configure_federation.html class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>official
documentation</a>
provides information required for Keystone configuration and can be used for
the reference, but it is not sufficient for the context of this article.</p><h1 id=keystone-in-few-words>Keystone in few words
<a class=heading-link href=#keystone-in-few-words><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h1><p>Keystone is an Identity provider service in OpenStack. In it&rsquo;s current version
it serves few major purposes:</p><ul><li><p>manage identity resources (users, domain, projects, catalogs)</p></li><li><p>authenticate/authorize users granting them session API token</p></li><li><p>verify user presented token (this capability is normally used by other
services to verify the user is valid and can do what he tries to do)</p></li></ul><p>By default Keystone is keeping user data locally and thus builds itself an
identity authority. But it can also be combined with external identity
authorities in which case it is named as &ldquo;Federation&rdquo;. There are few built-in
protocols that Keystone supports to delegate user data authority to the
third party:</p><ul><li><p>LDAP</p></li><li><p>OpenIDConnect</p></li><li><p>Saml2</p></li></ul><p>In the scope of this series we are going to look at how to configure Keystone to
delegate user management to the Keycloak based on the OpenIDConnect protocol.</p><h2 id=federation-issues>Federation Issues
<a class=heading-link href=#federation-issues><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>The only possibility for building up a federation in Keystone was by
registering an external identity provider in a certain local domain. This has a
logical consequence that all users from the remote identity server are mapped
to the domain where the identity provider was registered. It works pretty well
when OpenStack installation is relatively small or being used as a private
cloud with no real segregation based on domains. For the wider use case,
however, this is not appropriate anymore. Of course it is possible to register
multiple identity providers in all required domains, but since Keystone on its
own delegates OpenIDConnect protocol work to additional plugins of the web
server (mod_oidc for Apache is one of those possibilities) it also means that
configuration for those plugins must be also repeated X times, not forgetting
the need to create also multiple OpenID clients in the Identity provider itself
to enable such mapping.</p><p>Next issue is related with the user authorization: which resources does the
user have access to and what are the privileges. In OpenStack this is
represented by roles granted to the user on a certain resources (project or
domain). This mapping is stored statically in OpenStack as CRUD based
resources. Now when we want to manage users in one system but their privileges
in another system this leads absolutely logically to a nightmare.</p><h2 id=why-federate-at-all>Why federate at all?
<a class=heading-link href=#why-federate-at-all><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>If you ask this question then most likely you do not need to have a federation
and you can just stretch the Keystone across multiple regions. Here we try to
provide some more information when having an external Identity provider is a
non-avoidable fact.</p><p>Security becomes more and more complex day by day. Simple 2-factor protection
is not considered safe anymore and additional device based account protections
are appearing (passkeys, hardware tokens, etc). Keystone is currently not able
to deal with such new possibilities. On another side there is often need to
reuse users in different applications (aside from OpenStack). This is actually
what OAuth and OpenIDConnect were created for separating the Identity providers
from Service providers. Keystone alone does not currently serves good as a good
Identity provider for applications outside of the OpenStack.</p><p>It would be technically possible to extend OpenStack services (Nova, Cinder,
Glance, etc) to work directly with an external Identity provider but would
require quite a big effort. It is much easier to make Keystone itself a Service
provider that deals with the user authorization (issue authorization token that
other OpenStack services accepts).</p><h1 id=improving-federation-capabilities-of-keystone>Improving federation capabilities of Keystone
<a class=heading-link href=#improving-federation-capabilities-of-keystone><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h1><p>Now that we understand why federation makes sense and which issues are there
currently we know what need to be improved.</p><p>As described in the previous chapter first problem that need to be solved is a
need to be able to map users from an external Identity provider into different
domains in OpenStack.</p><p>Keystone currently supports 2 different types of users: <code>local</code> and
<code>ephemeral</code>. A <code>local</code> user, as the name suggests, is a user that Keystone has
ownership of and is responsible for. An <code>ephemeral</code> one is a user that external
entity is owning, but Keystone must be aware of to grant OpenStack use.
Federation is relying on the <code>ephemeral</code> users. In order to let Keystone
recognise such external user it need to map it to a local &ldquo;ephemeral&rdquo; entity to
be able to grant roles, projects access, etc. Such users are not even stored in
the same DB table in Keystone where local users are stored.</p><p>Since a few years there was a solution proposed for the problem, but it was
unfortunately postponed for the next release (due to the timing constraints)
and later missed completely. Few companies interested in seeing the problem
finally solved came together and agreed on a collaboration to finally see the
improvements. With <a href=https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/keystone/+/739966 class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>this
change</a> improvement
of an ephemeral users handling has been finally merged and it became possible
to map users into different domains. One important thing here is that the
Domain must be existing by the time the federated users tries to login,
otherwise the authentication fails with no reasonable information available to
the user.</p><p>So let us quickly have a look at the steps and sample configuration of the
Keycloak, Keystone and the Apache web server in front of Keystone since we are
going to rely on the mod_oidc module for taking over the OpenIDConnect work.</p><h1 id=openidconnect-client-keycloak>OpenIDConnect client (Keycloak)
<a class=heading-link href=#openidconnect-client-keycloak><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h1><p>Since it is desired to have users managed inside of Keycloak being available
inside of Keystone it is necessary to create a client. There are lot of
<a href=https://openid.net/developers/specs/ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>existing materials</a> describing how the
OpenIDConnect works. <a href=https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>A High level
description</a> giving following
description to the &ldquo;Client&rdquo;:</p><blockquote><p>A client is a piece of software that requests tokens either for
authenticating a user or for accessing a resource (also often called a
relying party or RP). A client must be registered with the OP (OpenID
Provider). Clients can be web applications, native mobile and desktop
applications, etc.</p></blockquote><p>In Keycloak a &ldquo;Client&rdquo; is a CRUD resource representing the application (on our
case Keystone) that would be able to access user data. The &ldquo;Client&rdquo; has certain
configuration options that influence communication between both sides as well
as describes which specific OpenIDConnect workflows are supported
(Authorization Code, Implicit, Resource owner password credentials, Client
credentials, Device authorization, etc). With this amount of things that can be
misconfigured is relatively endless. Therefore we start with the most basic
configuration allowing us to see the Keycloak user being able to get the
Keystone token to further talk to other OpenStack services.</p><p>Keycloak has a decent GUI, but it is hard to describe in text which of 10000
check-boxes need to be checked. Actually there is nothing very specific on the
client for the moment except following properties:</p><ul><li><p>protocol: &ldquo;openid-connect&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>client authentication: &ldquo;on&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>authentication flow: standard, implicit (allowing more is not harming, but is
not necessary as of now)</p></li><li><p>Valid redirect URI. This is a tricky one to describe since it depends on how
Keystone is deployed. Since here we deploy both Keystone and Keycloak on the
localhost we use:</p><ul><li>http://localhost:5000/v3/auth/OS-FEDERATION/websso/openid</li><li>http://localhost:5000/identity/v3/auth/OS-FEDERATION/identity_providers/sso/protocols/openid/websso</li></ul></li></ul><p>Redirect URI is a safety measure to allow Keycloak redirect user back to the
Keystone and not let the flow being high-jacked by some other application.
The <code>http://localhost:5000/v3/auth/OS-FEDERATION/websso/openid</code> is used further
in the mod_auth_oidc configuration.</p><p>Once the client is created it is necessary to describe which data Keycloak is
going to expose to the client (Keystone) about the user. Our main target for
now is to expose user name and unique ID (ID of the Keystone). Another
crucially important user attribute is the domain name (or ID) that the user
must be assigned into in the Keystone. This is actually why all of the
improvements are required. Such configuration in Keycloak is being described by
a &ldquo;Client scope&rdquo;. Keycloak comes with default client scopes being
pre-configured for the OpenIDConnect and can be extended with the information
we are going to need. For the re-usability and configuration sanity it is,
however, suggested to create a dedicated client scope that will not configure
all the extensions and applied only to those clients, that really need them.</p><p><img src=../images/keycloak_client_scope.png alt="Client Scope"></p><p>As a next step we are going to create mappers that add defined user attributes
into the exposed information. For this we switch to the mappers tab and add a
new mapper with &ldquo;User attribute&rdquo; type. For every new attribute that we want
Keystone to get information about a dedicated mapper need to be created. It
does not actually matter how exactly user attributes are named, it is
recommended to keep certain consistency and all 3 attributes &ldquo;name&rdquo;, &ldquo;user
attribute&rdquo; and &ldquo;token_claim_name&rdquo; to use same value. Here we use &ldquo;openstack-&rdquo;
prefix for attributes</p><p><img src=../images/keycloak_client_scope_mapper.png alt="Client Scope"></p><p>In total we create following 2 mappers:</p><ul><li>openstack-user-name</li><li>openstack-user-domain-name (feel free to go for domain_id if necessary, but
this may bite if Keystones are installed per region)</li></ul><p>It is possible to define also something like &ldquo;openstack-user-id&rdquo; with a certain
unique ID of the user, we are going to rely on the unique ID of the user in the
Keycloak itself which is automatically available as &ldquo;sub&rdquo; (subject).</p><p>It is important to remember that if the client scope is not configured as a
&ldquo;Default&rdquo; type the data it is exposing may not become visible without
explicitly requesting this scope. It is just safe to make it default.</p><p>Next it we are going to create a user with the attributes configured above</p><p><img src=../images/keycloak_user_attributes.png alt="User attributes">
<strong>NOTE:</strong> It is very important to populate attributes for users otherwise they
will fail to get Keystone token without much useful information.</p><p>With this Keycloak configuration can be considered as &ldquo;Done&rdquo;</p><h1 id=keystone-configuration>Keystone configuration
<a class=heading-link href=#keystone-configuration><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h1><p>In order to understand certain values required in the Apache configuration we
are going to configure Keystone itself next. It is also a pretty strait forward process</p><h2 id=identity-provider>Identity Provider
<a class=heading-link href=#identity-provider><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>We need to register Keycloak as an identity provider in Keystone. This can be
achieved using
<a href=https://docs.openstack.org/api-ref/identity/v3-ext/#register-an-identity-provider class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>api</a> or the OpenStackClient</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none><code class=language-console data-lang=console><span style=display:flex><span>$ openstack identity provider create --remote-id https://localhost:8443/realms/master keycloak
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You can specify in which domain it is going to be created and until recently
that would mean that all users of this Identity provider would be also
belonging to this domain. Now this does not matter anymore and IDP can be
created in any suitable domain (of course that no end customer has access to).
Additionally certain description can be used and is highly recommended.
<code>remote-id</code> is something that builds a match between Keystone and Keycloak and
must be pointing to the realm in Keycloak where the client has been configured
in the previous step.</p><h2 id=mapping>Mapping
<a class=heading-link href=#mapping><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>Next step is to configure which attribute of Keycloak means what to the
Keystone. It is done using <code>mapping</code> and can be done using
<a href=https://docs.openstack.org/api-ref/identity/v3-ext/#create-a-mapping class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>api</a> or
using the OpenStackClient. However this is the first time things are becoming a
bit more complex and need to be done pretty carefully.</p><h4 id=mappingjson>mapping.json

This is a subject of changes currently being addressed and as such a topic for
the next part of the series. Since in real life such static configuration is
barely useful in a multi-domain setup we are not going to use it at all. Feel

</code></pre><p>Also here there are plenty of things that can be configured differently
(perhaps correct statement here is: wrong), especially since it all depends on
how exactly Keystone itself is being running (i.e. as uwsgi app or not) and
which ports are being exposed. What is important is that
<code>OIDCProviderMetadataURL</code> here points to the Keycloak we configured above (the
URL need to point to to the correct Keycloak realm where the client was
configured), <code>OIDCClientID</code> and <code>OIDCClientSecret</code> match ID and password of the
client.</p><p>In previous chapter we have seen that &ldquo;remote&rdquo; attributes of the Keystone
mapping all have &ldquo;OIDC-&rdquo; prefix. <code>OIDCClaimPrefix</code> is where it is configured.</p><p>For non-browser applications a dedicated endpoint is exposed that is not
expecting apps to do a regular authentication. We explicitly set the <code>AuthType</code>
for that to &ldquo;auth-openidc&rdquo; (actually &ldquo;oauth20&rdquo; is working absolutely same way
and can be interchanged).
<a href=https://github.com/OpenIDC/mod_auth_openidc/wiki/OAuth-2.0-Resource-Server#keycloak class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>mod_auth_openidc</a>
describes 2 different approaches of the access token validation: remote and
local. Depending on the preferred choice configuration must be extended with
either <code>OIDCOAuthVerifyJwksUri</code> or with <code>OIDCOAuthIntrospectionEndpoint</code> +
<code>OIDCOAuthClientID</code> + <code>OIDCOAuthClientSecret</code></p><p>Depending on whether the Horizon is being used or not and which authentication
methods users need to use there other parts that need to be configured, but
that is not belonging to the Keystone-Keycloak communication directly.
Therefore we can consider configuration as complete. Now if Keystone is started
as uwsgi app (according to the Apache config above), Apache server started and
running and Keycloak being available a user trying to authenticate in the Web
Browser
(http://localhost:5000/v3/OS-FEDERATION/identity_providers/keycloak/protocols/openid/websso?origin=http://localhost:5050)
would be redirected to the Keycloak for authentication after which the browser
will redirect to the &ldquo;http://localhost:5050&rdquo; as entered in the &ldquo;origin&rdquo; URI
parameter with the OpenStack token being part of the request.</p><h1 id=keystone-configuration-1>Keystone configuration

&ldquo;discovery_endpoint&rdquo; and performs direct communication with it in order to
obtain an access token. With it it then performs the next call to
&ldquo;<code>http://localhost:5000</code>/v3/OS-FEDERATION/identity_providers/<code>keycloak</code>/protocols/<code>openid</code>/auth&rdquo;
(auth_url, identity_provider and protocol from the configuration are used to
construct this path). This is exactly the Location in the Apache configuration
with the <code>auth-openidc</code> configuration. Instead of the discovery_endpoint it is
possible to specify <code>access_token_endpoint</code> directly.</p><p>There are few major issues isung this approach</p><ul><li><p>No support for MFA. Once user enables additional account protection (
actually one of the reasons somebody may want to have a IDP is to enforce and
control certain security aspects) this method stops working.</p></li><li><p>Need to have user password outside the IDP. With OAuth and OpenIDConnect this
is exactly what we want to prevent</p></li><li><p>Need for the user to know IDP details. User need to know IDP endpoint. But
what is worse is a need to also know client_id and client_secret. This makes it
not really usable in a wide scope.</p></li></ul><h2 id=authorization-code-grant-and-the-remaining-oauth-flows>Authorization Code Grant and the remaining OAuth flows
<a class=heading-link href=#authorization-code-grant-and-the-remaining-oauth-flows><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>This is currently a recommended way of user authentication. Sadly it is not
properly supported in the OpenStackClient as of now. There is an existing OSC
plugin available
<a href=https://github.com/IFCA-Advanced-Computing/keystoneauth-oidc/tree/master class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>here</a>
which is, however, not capable to work with upstream Keystone</p><p>Since the plugin has no direct relation towards the OpenStack upstream
community it is left without further comments here.</p><p>OAuth2 and OpenIDConnect in most cases require knowing the Client created in
the IDP (client_id, client_secret). That means that a separate set of access
data is required that user must maintain. What is also representing a challenge
is that this requires making the client publicly available (since it is
impossible to assume that client_secret will remain secret). Due to this fact
and availability of the mod_auth_oidc another way is the preferred one.</p><h2 id=mod_auth_oidc-as-oauth2openid-connect-relying-party>mod_auth_oidc as OAuth2/OpenID Connect Relying Party
<a class=heading-link href=#mod_auth_oidc-as-oauth2openid-connect-relying-party><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>mod_auth_oidc is configured with a dedicated client on the IDP. When a user
attempts to access protected resources the request is being redirected towards
the IDP starting a transparent for the user Authorization Code (or Token) grant
authentication. Once user successfully authenticates with the IDP he is
redirected back to the requested &ldquo;trusted_dashboard&rdquo;. This redirect will arrive
as a POST request with OpenStack token present in the request body. The process
is so transparent that no OAuth2/OpenIDConnect libraries are required. In the
Keystone this flow is represented under the &ldquo;websso&rdquo; endpoint.</p><p>Single Sign On is currently not supported in python-openstackclient. A new
experimental OpenStack CLI <a href=https://github.com/gtema/openstack class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>osc</a> is
addressing this gap and tries to deal with authentication differently trying to
save user from unnecessary re-authentication upon every time a session is being
established</p><p>Following <code>clouds.yaml</code> configuration is sufficient for that usecase.</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none><code class=language-yaml data-lang=yaml><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#f92672>clouds</span>:

and it is required to explicitly allow this URL in the list of trusted
dashboards in the <code>keystone.conf</code>.</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> SSO by default relies on the user interaction (with user interacting
with the IDP in the browser), therefore also this method is hardly applicable
for the machine to machine usecase</p><p>In the next part we are going to have a deeper look on what is required to
implement dynamic mapping of federated users to projects and groups/roles with
data maintained by the IDP itself. Since this is still not implemented in the
Keystone it will describe current state of things.</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
